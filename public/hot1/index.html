      Hello! My name is Sam Downs and I am attending Ranken Technical College for Application and Web Development. So
      far the course is pretty fun, I am definitely not expecting it to be an easy course, so I will have to manage my
      school life more than I did in highschool. To be fair I did expect this after hearing all of the stories my family
      members have told me. I enjoy technology, gaming, sports, and travelling.
