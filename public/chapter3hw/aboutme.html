      <p>
        Here is a little bit about me! I am Sam Downs, son of my parents, and brother to my brother obviously. My
        hobbies include gaming adventuring, technology, and sports. Something interesting about me inlcudes that I am
        actually the fourth person in my family to attend Ranken, if you include a second cousin. What is crazy to me is
        that they all went for different things in different times, so I am staying true to my family way. Lastly I
        don't know what to say. Homework in this class is fun or something. I like to adventure, travel, this is for
        chapter 3.
